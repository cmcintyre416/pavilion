I won't get all techy on how capital requirements work but will give a bit of background.\n\nAfter the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 08/09, the Bank for International Settlements (the BIS) and local bank regulators (the Fed in the USA and OSFI in Canada), stated that Systemically Important Banks (SIB's - Canada's Big 6 are all SIB's) would all need to issue securities that classify as Tier 1 Capital over a multi-year period of about 7 years to hit certain capital requirement thresholds.  The entire idea was that after the GFC, tax payers would no longer be responsible for bailing out SIB's because they would have much higher capital buffers in place. \n\nThis is obviously a good thing for financial stability but comes with a few caveats for investors.\n\nThe first line item to learn is about Bail-in capital securities.  These are considered senior notes (bonds at or near the top of the capital structure) issued by the Banks.  In the past, they would have remained senior notes even during an event of default but the Bail-in rules state that if the issuing Bank was considered (by their regulator) \"non-viable\", then those  senior notes you thought you owned turn into... common equity (at the absolute bottom of the capital structure) on a ratio basis.  \n\nSecondly, there is another type of security the Banks issued over the past 7 years called \"NVCC\" (non-viability contingent capital). Included in NVCC are, you guessed it...Prefs (and subordinated notes/bonds).  Now Prefs qualify for Tier 1 capital raised by the Banks to satisfy their threshold requirements and given they have been happily bought by Advisors for their clients (Advisors get paid by the issuing Bank a 3% upfront commission to sell a new issue Pref to their clients), the Banks were happy issuers.  A quick note that if Bail-in securities convert to common equity on a non-viable event, so too do NVCC securities, but at a lesser ratio.  Last word on Bail-in and NVCC securities - they have massively skewed the risk of owning Bank Common Equity over the last 7yrs  because if a Bank is declared non-viable and all these Bail-in and NVCC securities automatically swap to Common Equity, you would naturally see a huge amount of dilution of that Common Equity.  Tax payers would be off the hook as all this Bank Debt would automatically swap into Common Equity.   Now, I am not saying that any Canadian Bank is about to declared non-viable but, if one was, the risk would be unquantifiable, at least compared to 10+ years ago.  \n\nBack to Prefs, in particular.  The Banks issued about $5bln of Prefs per year over the last 5 years or so.  They largely issued \"rate-resets\" which typically are issued with a fixed coupon/dividend for the first 5 years and then reset to a new fixed coupon/dividend over the next 5 years and do so...forever.  This was a great gig for the Banks to raise T1 capital as retail Advisors were not exactly discriminate about the initial yield (when they were getting paid 3% to sell a new issue).  The only downside for the Banks was, they couldn't deduct the dividends paid from Revenues, like interest expense from a bond because technically, dividends are paid after tax.   So with about $5bln Prefs being issued by the Banks, there was a ton of supply in the market.  Also hurting performance was that interest rates (gov't bond yields) declined rapidly and so that \"reset\" rate (usually 5yr Canada yield) was lower so expectations for higher dividends continued to decline.  \n\nAlong comes RBC.  They created a new mechanism to issue T1 capital securities (called AT1 or Additional Tier 1) that allow them to deduct the interest expense on the Income Statement so these new securities look more like a bond than a Pref but still qualify for AT1 capital because RBC issues a Pref that is ring-fenced should they default on their newly issues AT1 capital bonds.\n\nConfusing for sure but suffice to say that because of this new type of security, the supply of Rate Reset Prefs that have been hitting the market the last 5 years, will subside massively as every Bank will be hopping on board. some may even try to buy back these deeply depressed Prefs.  Regardless, the net effect of this new AT1 security was that Rate Reset Prefs rallied about 5-11% the day this was announced almost two weeks ago. \n\nFor our High Rock clients, you know that over the years, we have been ultra cautious on Prefs in general and it has served us well.  Back in 2015/2016 we did own a few Fixed Rate Prefs, swapped them for Rate-Reset Prefs, which worked out extremely well, and then held a small exposure to Rate-Resets for the last few years.  (Remember, Prefs are not Fixed Income but rather \"Senior Equity\"!  Caveat Emptor, especially if you don't understand Bail-in and NVCC.)\n\nAt High Rock we have a wicked excel macro model to value Rate-Reset Prefs which entails looking at the two main drivers - 1) Investment Grade Corporate Bond Spreads and 2) the 5yr Gov't of Can bond curve today, the 5yr/5yr forward, the 10yr/5yr forward, etc.  The end result allows us to compare the Implied Credit Spread on the Prefs (to compare to the Investment Grade Corp Spreads) and the IRR (Internal Rate of Return) of the Prefs.  This model is invaluable for our Pref investments. \n\nI probably got too techy but if anyone wants to learn more, feel free to reach out:  paul@highrockcapital.ca","title":"Preferred Shares Improve","description":"For those long-suffering Preferred Share investors, you will notice a nice bump higher in that section of your portfolio this month (or two weeks ago, if you look at your account more regularly)."}},"pageContext":{"slug":"preffered-shares-impr"}}}
