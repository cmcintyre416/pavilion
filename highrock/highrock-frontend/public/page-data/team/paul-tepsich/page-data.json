{"componentChunkName":"component---src-templates-team-template-js","path":"/team/paul-tepsich","result":{"data":{"team":{"id":"Teams_3","name":"Paul Tepsich","position":"Managing Partner and Portfolio Manager","description":"I founded High Rock Capital in 2010.  Prior to founding High Rock, I worked at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc for over 17 years trading all sectors of the Canadian fixed income market but with a particular focus on high yield, distressed debt and capital structure arbitrage.  It was there I developed deep fundamental research and financial modeling skills.  I was Head of Canadian Credit Trading at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc. and was responsible for portfolios totaling up to $13 billion until my departure in 2008.  \n\nFrom 2009 until 2010, I was a Portfolio Manager at a Toronto and Calgary-based investment firm, where I was the lead manager for two newly formed long/short high yield bond funds.  The firm’s flagship high yield fund was a top-quartile performer while I was the lead portfolio manager. \n\n​At High Rock, I am the Portfolio Manager on the funds we manage for Scotiabank in our Institutional division as well as our Private Client models.  My work is largely focused on \"bottom-up\" fundamental research.  I am also the Chief Compliance Officer at High Rock.  \n\nI am a frequent guest speaker on BNN and have been a guest lecturer (3yrs) for Queen's University, Master of Finance, where I lectured on Credit, High Yield, Distressed Debt and Fundamental Analysis/Modeling (no one fell asleep during my tenure). \n\nI grew up in Burlington and attended Nelson High School but have lived in Toronto for over 30 years.  I am luckily married to my wife Nancy and try very hard to keep up to our three sons, Macallum (skiing), Harrison (basketball) and Nicholas (snowboard racing) (no small task).  I have been actively involved in the cycling community in Toronto and am a former Board Member of the Morning Glory Cycling Club where I initiated and chaired the Club's philanthropy committee.   I am an avid road cyclist, runner, skier and a passionate outdoorsman.  \n\nI hold a BA Financial Studies/Economics (1985) from King's College (University of Western Ontario) and a CFA charterholder (1991).","slug":"paul-tepsich","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.408450704225352,"src":"/static/4d74f0b5c3afea847fa30321caf8bd0d/8f7df/ad821621817937aa2a6ffed7745bb59a.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4d74f0b5c3afea847fa30321caf8bd0d/f836f/ad821621817937aa2a6ffed7745bb59a.jpg 200w,\n/static/4d74f0b5c3afea847fa30321caf8bd0d/8f7df/ad821621817937aa2a6ffed7745bb59a.jpg 250w","sizes":"(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"paul-tepsich"}}}
