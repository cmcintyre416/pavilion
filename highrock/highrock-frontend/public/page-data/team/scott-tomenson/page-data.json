Prior to joining High Rock, I spent 15 years as a Vice President, Senior Investment Advisor, Portfolio Manager and Branch Manager at several Canadian Investment Dealers and as a partner in the Turner Tomenson Wealth Management Group with more than 700 families and approx. $400 million in assets under administration.  My main focus was to assist families in assessing and managing their investment risk and ensuring that they were steadily progressing toward their goals. Through the 1980's and 1990's, I spent 20 years as a Vice President, Fixed Income Trader and Risk Manager in both Canada and the United States at leading Banks and  Investment Dealers, honing my skills for managing risk.  \n\nAt High Rock, I am the Chief Investment Strategist and Associate Portfolio Manager.  I focus on \"top-down\" research and formulate our \"macro\" view of the larger financial world and the appropriate asset allocation strategy to go with it. I blend my time between macro research, portfolio management and client service.  Most importantly, I am on a mission to bring the public up to date on the very big difference between old school \"investment advice\" and the more fiduciarily responsible art of portfolio and wealth management.\n\nI hold a BA in Economics from the University of Western Ontario (1980) and the Chartered Investment Manager designation (2014). I was recently awarded the certificate in Advanced Investment Advice (Click here to view).\n\nI live in Toronto with my incredible wife Mary (Maria Letizia Canella) and we have three wonderful daughters: Miranda ( www.mirandatomenson.com/ ) is a Professional Triathlete, Coach and RMT, Sara is a Montesori Teacher (and triathlete) and Bianca is a Certified Financial Planning professional. We have two grandchildren, Maddy and Mason and three step-grand children, Saige, Rhys and Mack, all of whom we are very proud! Mary and I actively support New Circles (www.newcircles.ca) and the Daily Bread Food Bank.  Mary and I play a lot of Golf together. I also enjoy Stand Up Paddleboarding and Kiteboarding, Mary is an artist in the kitchen (so I need to spend time in the gym). The rest of the time we travel around supporting our triathlete daughters (thank you remote connectivity). twitter.com/JSTomenson","slug":"scott-tomenson","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7543859649122806,"src":"/static/95f3ee54938cc6629a8264dad84134b4/862d9/8627dc6e79034a1e17d16607e6a41e2d.jpg","srcSet":"/static/95f3ee54938cc6629a8264dad84134b4/f836f/8627dc6e79034a1e17d16607e6a41e2d.jpg 200w,\n/static/95f3ee54938cc6629a8264dad84134b4/862d9/8627dc6e79034a1e17d16607e6a41e2d.jpg 345w","sizes":"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"scott-tomenson"}}}
